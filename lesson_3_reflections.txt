When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    use it as backup, u can use it to collaborate with others on the same project
    you can use it to access and/or present ur projects easily on other devices

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    you dont want your code to change while u r working on it

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    clone: copy a rep. from github to ur local drive or copy a rep.
           from one place to another locally
    fork: cloning between accounts on github
    branch: a series of commits
    
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    you will be able to test if you can merge your changes without causing
    conflicts with origin/master

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    i would use file sharing websites, everything would be alot harder

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    so that others review my code if im collaborating, and also to only have 
    solid production code in master before merging experimental features into it
