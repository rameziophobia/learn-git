How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it skipped lines that had no changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    if i tala3t masarin el code i could roll back to a working version or watch
    the history and see what could have caused the issue without wasting time in
    debugging

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: will save code only when im sure that it works
          will make the commits more meaningful

    cons: slower
          you may forget to make a commit


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because in programming changing one file might have an effect on other files, google docs 
    however deals with normal documents in which a file change wont have an effect on other 
    files   

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the list of commits and get diff can be used to show the difference bet. 2 
    commits so 
    1. type git log
    2. copy the 2 commit IDs you want 
    3. type git diff ID1 ID2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    i can go back if smth breaks so its okay to go and try

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    project elgam3a xDD
